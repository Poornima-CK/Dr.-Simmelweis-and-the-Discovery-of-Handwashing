**Dr. Simmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing**

Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician at the Vienna General Hospital, conducted a pioneering study on childbed fever, a fatal disease that affected women shortly after childbirth. In the early 1840s, this fever claimed the lives of up to 10% of women giving birth at the hospital. Semmelweis made the groundbreaking connection between these high mortality rates and the contaminated hands of doctors, who often delivered babies immediately after performing autopsies without washing their hands.

Through his meticulous research, Semmelweis discovered that enforcing a strict handwashing protocol dramatically reduced the mortality rate, saving hundreds of lives. This breakthrough transformed medical practices and highlighted the critical role of hygiene in healthcare.

In this notebook, we will reanalyze the historical data that led Semmelweis to this life-saving realization about the importance of handwashing. We will begin by examining the data that exposed flaws in the procedures at the Vienna General Hospital.

**Step 1:**

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

We will first explore the data to understand trends and patterns related to mortality rates in the hospital.

**Step 2:**

**Calculate the yearly proportion of deaths in Clinic 1 and Clinic 2**

Here, we'll calculate and compare the yearly death rates in the two clinics at the hospital to investigate the differences in outcomes.

**Step 3:**

**Compare the results of before and after handwashing was introduced**

By comparing data from the periods before and after the handwashing intervention, we can observe the impact of this practice on reducing deaths.

**Step 4:**

**Bootstrap analysis of handwashing data**

A bootstrap analysis will be conducted to estimate the uncertainty around the reduction in mortality rates. According to the analysis, the introduction of handwashing reduced deaths by approximately 8%. We will use the bootstrap method to calculate a confidence interval, providing a better understanding of the reliability of this estimate.

**Step 5:**

**Recommendation**

Based on the analysis, handwashing was found to be a key factor in reducing childbed fever-related deaths. The data strongly supports the recommendation that all doctors and medical personnel should adopt rigorous handwashing practices to prevent further fatalities.
This reanalysis highlights the enduring significance of Semmelweis' discovery and its ongoing relevance in the field of medical hygiene.
